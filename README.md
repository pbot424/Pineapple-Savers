# Pineapple Savers

A simple web-based roguelike experiment built with HTML5 canvas. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

## Future Work
- Add enemies and combat
- Item pickups and inventory
- Procedural dungeon generation

## Design Notes
This initial version randomly fills the map with walls and allows basic player movement. It provides a starting point for future features like combat and dungeon generation.
